# This lesson covers MVC with Flask in Python

## MVC - Model View Controller
### Display data on the browser using HTML, CSS JS and BOOTSTRAP

- HTML - Hyper Text markup language
- CSS - Cascading Style sheet
- JS - Java Script 
- BOOTSTRAP

**Building our API***
- display data from python flask to specific API call/URL/end point/
 
 **WHY FLASK and USE CASES**
 - Flask is a web app frame work
 - Very powerful to interact with DB and user interface/browsers etc
 - Flask can be used to create an API
 - It allows us to integrate with HTML, CSS JS 
 - It allows us to map HTTP requests to python functions - URL - HTTP GET
 - It allows us to set the API path as URL to view in the browser 
 
 - Let's install Flask
 ```python
pip install flask
```
- Ensure flask is installed

- How to run the flask app - command
```
flask run
```
**interacting with HTML**
- Naming conventions are essential
- we need create templates folder in our dir
- flask looks for templates folder and anything inside the folder
- we will create index.html inside our templates folder


- Bootstrap to design our page with HTML, CSS JS
